Multi-disciplinary full stack software engineer and engineering manager passionate about all things code, design, product and UI/UX.

Working at Microsoft for the past 6 years, on a wide range of products.
I have worked on large-scale security products at Defender for Cloud, innovations in security and AI in the security CTO office, and now leading a team in a highly innovative security product.

I have experience with a variety of technologies and stacks, and a background in graphic and motion design.
Focused on solving problems and delivering value over choice/expertise of specific technologies.
